# Board Members

## Scott Hammond, Joyent

I am the CEO of Joyent and full background can be found [on
joyent.com](https://www.joyent.com/about/management). I joined Joyent in 2014
and immediately immersed myself in Node.js. I was ecstatic with the widespread
adoption of Node and the success users are having with the platform, but very
concerned with some of the tension in the vendor and developer communities. We
are working hard to ensure that the Foundation will provide some of the
missing ingredients we need to secure a bright future for Node.js. The
Foundation will help de-risk the project for the user community and provide
the neutrality and inclusiveness needed to grow the vendor ecosystem and unite
the developer communities. I believe we are just scratching the surface on the
potential for Node and am optimistic about the future we can build together.

Open Standards and Open Source are both key components in SAP's strategy. As

Node.js is driven by a broad and independent community of industry and
technology leaders. SAP is proud to support these efforts by focusing on its

long term supportability. We are looking forward to cooperate with the other
foundation members to further advance the Node.js technology and constantly
