# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Node.js, there are multiple ways
and places you can contribute and we're here to help facilitate that.

## Reporting an Issue

If you have found what you believe to be an issue with Node.js please do not
hesistate to file an issue on the GitHub project. When filing your issue please
make sure you can express the issue with a reproducible test case, and that
test case should not include any external dependencies. That is to say, the
test case can be executed without anything more than Node.js itself.

When reporting an issue we also need as much information about your environment
that you can include. We never know what information will be pertinent when
trying narrow down the issue. Please include at least the following
information:

 * Version of Node
 * Platform you're running on (OS X, SunOS, Linux, Windows)
 * Architecture you're running on (32bit or 64bit and x86 or ARM)

The Node.js project is currently managed across a number of separate
Github repositories, each with their own separate issues database. If
possible, please direct any issues you are reporting to the appropriate
repository but don't worry if things happen to get put in the wrong place,
the community of contributors will be more than happy to help get you
pointed in the right direction.
