# NodeSchool

Node.js and the related ecosystem around Node. There are a series of curricula
which are designed with a choose your own adventure style. They are meant to
help you learn core concepts of Node.js but it also provides a framework for
creating your own curriculum.

NodeSchool is fantastic not just because it helps members of the communtiy to
learn about Node and its ecosystem, but because they provide a framework that
can be replicated in your own community to train your members. They provide
these resources free of charge and open source to make it easy for anyone to
