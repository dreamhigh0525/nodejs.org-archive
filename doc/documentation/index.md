# About Documentation

It's important for Node.js to provide documentation to its users, but
documentation means different things to different people. Here on nodejs.org
you will find three types of documentation, reference documentation, getting
started documentation, and tutorials.

Our [API reference documentation](/api/) is meant to provide detailed version
information about a given method or pattern in Node.js. From this documentation
you should be able to identify what input a method has, the return value of
that method, and what if any errors may be related to method. You should also
be able to identify which methods are available for different versions of
Node.js.

The Getting Started materials are meant to ease you into some of the concepts
found in Node. They are meant to be approachable unopinionated pieces to help
you understand the patterns you will see in the Node.js APIs as well as in
other modules provided from the community.

Tutorials are for slightly more advanced topics, documentation meant to guide
the user through specific use cases for Node.js. This is meant to highlight the
different and varied use cases that can be found for Node.js, but are not meant
to discuss the third party modules that are found in the community.

All of this documentation is meant to only highlight the builtin core modules
provided by Node, and not to highlight the module and collection of modules
found in the community. Node.js doesn't want to be in the business of picking
winners or losers, so to avoid the appearance of favoritism we only discuss
our APIs.
